# Spyce CopilotKit Integration Guide

## üèÜ Contest Entry: Best AI Copilot Integration

This document explains how we've successfully integrated CopilotKit into **Spyce** - our advanced competitive intelligence platform - **directly into the existing dashboard** without breaking any existing functionality, while significantly enhancing the user experience with AI-powered features.

## üöÄ What We've Built

Our existing dashboard now features **seamlessly integrated AI capabilities** powered by CopilotKit that provide:

- **Interactive AI Assistant Sidebar**: Context-aware chatbot that understands your competitive intelligence needs
- **Smart Text Completion**: AI-powered autocomplete in the main dashboard for research queries  
- **Custom AI Actions**: Specialized functions for competitor analysis, discovery suggestions, and strategic planning
- **Enhanced Existing Workflows**: All current features remain exactly the same, but now with AI superpowers
- **Zero Disruption**: Users can continue using the dashboard as before, with optional AI assistance

## üéØ Integration Strategy: Enhancement, Not Replacement

Unlike creating a separate AI interface, we took the approach of **enhancing the existing user experience**:

### 1. **Domains Tab Enhancement**
- Added AI Research Assistant panel with smart query input
- CopilotTextarea with intelligent autocomplete for research queries
- Toggle-able AI Assistant sidebar for in-depth analysis
- All existing domain management functionality preserved

### 2. **AI Agents Tab Enhancement** 
- Added CopilotKit features banner highlighting AI capabilities
- Enhanced existing AgentDashboard with AI context
- Preserved all existing discovery, crawling, and research operations
- Added AI-powered insights and recommendations

### 3. **Smart Navigation**
- CopilotKit branding in header without cluttering
- Visual indicators for AI-enhanced features
- Contextual AI assistance available throughout

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Core Integration Points

#### 1. **Dashboard Enhancement** (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// CopilotKit context integration
useCopilotReadable({
  description: "Current user information and monitored competitor domains",
  value: {
    user: user ? { id: user.$id, name: user.name, email: user.email } : null,
    domains: domains.map(d => ({
      id: d.$id, domain: d.domain, name: d.name,
      description: d.description, status: d.status, lastCrawled: d.lastCrawled
    })),
    totalDomains: domains.length,
    activeDomains: domains.filter(d => d.status === 'active').length
  },
});

// Custom AI Actions for competitive intelligence
useCopilotAction({
  name: "analyzeCompetitor",
  description: "Analyze a specific competitor domain for insights and recommendations",
  // ... implementation
});
```

#### 2. **Smart Text Input Integration**
```typescript
<CopilotTextarea
  className="w-full p-3 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg"
  placeholder="Ask me anything about your competitors..."
  value={aiQuery}
  onChange={(e) => setAiQuery(e.target.value)}
  autosuggestionsConfig={{
    textareaPurpose: "Competitive intelligence research query for analyzing competitors and market insights",
    chatApiConfigs: { suggestionsApiConfig: {} },
  }}
/>
```

#### 3. **AI Assistant Sidebar**
```typescript
<CopilotSidebar
  instructions="You are an expert competitive intelligence assistant. Help users analyze competitors, discover market insights, identify trends, and develop strategic recommendations."
  labels={{
    title: "üîç Intelligence Assistant",
    initial: "How can I help you with competitive intelligence today?",
  }}
  defaultOpen={showAiAssistant}
  clickOutsideToClose={false}
/>
```

### Custom AI Actions

We've implemented three specialized AI actions:

1. **`analyzeCompetitor`**: Provides detailed analysis of monitored competitors with actionable recommendations
2. **`suggestCompetitors`**: Intelligent competitor discovery suggestions based on industry analysis  
3. **`generateResearchPlan`**: Creates strategic research plans tailored to business goals and timeframes

### Data Context Integration

The AI has complete access to:
- User profile and preferences
- All monitored competitor domains
- Domain statuses and metadata
- Recent crawling activity
- Research history and patterns

## üé® User Experience Flow

### Existing Users (Zero Disruption)
1. Users login and see their familiar dashboard
2. Notice subtle "Powered by CopilotKit" indicator
3. Can continue using all existing features exactly as before
4. Optional: Click "Show Assistant" for AI help

### New AI-Enhanced Workflow
1. Users interact with enhanced smart text inputs
2. AI provides contextual suggestions and autocomplete
3. Ask questions via sidebar assistant
4. Get intelligent recommendations for competitive research
5. Receive strategic insights based on monitored competitors
